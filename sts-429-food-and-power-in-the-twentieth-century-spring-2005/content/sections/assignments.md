Requirements
------------

This is primarily a research seminar, albeit one with a lot of reading. There are two requirements. First, students will take turns leading the seminar each week. Second, students will develop a research paper topic that is original and that draws upon available primary materials. Paper length should be 30 to 50 pages (the preference is for 30).
